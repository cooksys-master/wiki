# Group Final

For this assessment students will work in a group(s) to write a full stack application. This will incorporate everything we 
learned in the classroom. Students will be given tasks across the full stack to ensure everyone works on all pieces of the 
application. The application will be managed in a simulated kan ban agile style and will make use of Github issues and Zenhub. 
During the first day of the assessment students will gather requirements with their techlead from stakeholders and begin 
designing and setting up the structure of their application. The target for the first week is to finish version 1.0 of their 
application and be ready for more requirements for week 2. The cut off for the project will be noon on Thursday of week 2. 
That afternoon students will put together their presentations and each group will do at minimum 1 practice run. Friday 
morning students will present their final projects.


## To Start the Application. 

#### Server Setup
git clone the project. cd into the sever directory, and run your prefered JAVA IDE. Open this project as a MAVEN project,  then perform a `clean install` with MAVEN. Once that is done, 
the server will be able to be started up. 

`NOTE: This Project is set up for PostgreSQL, and the dbname its set for is cook_wiki.`

You will need to add this database to your PostgreSQL server, or edit application.properties

#### Client Setup
cd into the client directory, run `npm install` then run `npm start`, and the application will be started up. 

Remember to populate the database, and you will be set.
